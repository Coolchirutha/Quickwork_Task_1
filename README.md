# Quickwork_Task_1
Finishing the problem statement given by Quickwork for their assessment before hiring an intern.

## Problem Statement
Build an API in NodeJS using express to send emails using the Gmail REST API. Do not use the client libraries.
Your application should -

1. Obtain a Gmail user's credentials using OAuth 2.0. The OAuth 2.0 process should be initiated by an API call to your server.
2. Store the obtained credentials in a file.
3. Have an API endpoint to execute send email using the credentials previously stored.
4. Include appropriate comments in your code on how to use the APIs written by you.
5. Upload the server code to your Github and share the repository link with us. There is no need for a visual interface, only the server code is needed.
